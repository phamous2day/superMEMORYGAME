# superMEMORYGAME



For the first draft, I've designed the grid to hold the tiles using <div> and using "float: left" in the CSS.
Without "float: left" the images will stack on top each other.
Using float will arrange each image/tiles to the left of each other.

To give the images a cool flip/turn-over effect, CSS "transform" and z-index properties were one of distinguishing features.

Count the amount of moves.
